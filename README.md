# CCS30-3D-SCENE

 1. how do I approach designing software?
 The easiest way I personally have found for myself to approach designing software is to sit back and visualize (or note down) everything that needs to be done and using psuedocode helps a lot because it gives you a base list of everything you need to do in case you get lost in what you are designing and cannot think of how you needed to do the next step. My new skills I have learned from this project is I can now create some more basic 3D scenes in openGL which I could not previously create.
 
 2. How do I approach developing programs?
 I approach developing programs in a similar manner as designing the software. On this project I used more code comments than I normally do because I am not always the best at remembering to add comments which adding comments were definitely necessary in completing the milestones and ultimately this project that way you can find where you left off easier. 
 
 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 My career goals did not include computational graphics, however the knowledge I gained from this class improves my future if I want to pursue coding further in my career as it was a real challenge using openGL with a lack of experience. Also, if I ever decide to pursue computational graphics I am at least one step closer to understanding them better.
